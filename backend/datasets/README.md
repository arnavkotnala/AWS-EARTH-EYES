## Deforestation rating (Forest Eyes)

The severity card rates the **annual deforestation rate**: tree cover lost 2001-2024 (UMD/Hansen, >=30 % canopy, via the
GFW Data API or Global Nature Watch) as a share of the tree cover in 2000 in the same box, compound form
r = 100 / t x ln(A2000 / (A2000 - loss)) (Puyravaud 2003). Scale: low < 0.3, mid 0.3-1.0, high 1.0-2.0, very high > 2.0 %/yr
(project thresholds). Tree cover in 2000 is counted from GFW's `umd_tree_cover_density_2000/v1.8/tcd_30` map tiles at zoom 12
(`forest-extent.js`, an estimate; coarser zooms overcount by 6-12 %, so they are not used up to a 50 km radius).

## Forest Eyes tree planner ("Which trees can grow here?")

| Data | What it is used for | Source / terms |
|---|---|---|
| `data/tree-species.json` (92 trees) | Each tree's temperature, rainfall, soil pH, texture and light ranges, growing-season length and killing temperature | FAO ECOCROP, as packaged in the Recocrop R package (Hijmans, github.com/cropmodels/Recocrop, GPL-3). Built by `scripts/build-tree-species.py` from `inst/parameters/ecocrop.rds`. The package notes the values are expert opinion, not field-validated optima. Species list and English/Indian names are ours. |
| ERA5 reanalysis, last 5 full years (live) | Monthly temperature, winter lows; sunshine hours from solar radiation (FAO-56 Angstrom-Prescott, a = 0.25, b = 0.50); rainfall only where CHPclim has no land cell | Copernicus Climate Change Service / ECMWF, via the Open-Meteo archive API (`models=era5_seamless`), CC BY 4.0. |
| `data/rain_chpclim.bin` | Annual rainfall (long-term mean): India region at 0.05°, world at 0.1° (`rainfall.js`) | CHPclim v1, Climate Hazards Group, UC Santa Barbara (satellite + rain-gauge climatology), data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHPclim/v1. Built by `scripts/build-rainfall.py` from the 12 monthly GeoTIFFs. Replaces ERA5 rainfall, which was far off at town scale (2021-2025 ERA5 vs CHPclim: Srinagar 2673 vs 699 mm, Pune 1454 vs 798, Dehradun 1350 vs 1734). Users can still enter their own value. |
| `data/tree-native.json` | Native / introduced status of each tree by TDWG region ("Native here", "Introduced here", "Not recorded here") | Kew *World Checklist of Vascular Plants* (WCVP), read through GBIF (dataset f382f0ce-323a-4091-bb9f-add557f3a9a2), CC BY 4.0. Built by `scripts/build-native-ranges.js`. |
| `data/tdwg-level3.geojson` | Which TDWG botanical region a point is in (`tdwg.js`) | TDWG *World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions*, level 3 (github.com/tdwg/wgsrpd). The repository states no licence; widely used for WCVP/POWO data. |
| `data/tree-traits/*.json` | Extra trees and traits added by the team, every value with source, page and quote, checked by a person | See `data/tree-traits/README.md`; checked with `scripts/check-tree-traits.js`. |
| CAMS global, last 365 days (live) | O3 (AOT40, daylight hours, worst 6 months), SO2 (annual and winter half-year means), NOx (NO2 + NO as NO2) | Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service via the Open-Meteo air-quality API, modelled (~40 km). |
| Critical levels for vegetation | SO2 20 ug/m3 (forests, Table 3.1), NOx 30 ug/m3 annual (Table 3.2), O3 AOT40 5 ppm h for trees (Table 3.17) | UNECE CLRTAP *Manual on Methodologies and Criteria for Modelling and Mapping Critical Loads and Levels*, chapter 3 (German Environment Agency, Texte 123/2024). |

**Validation** (`scripts/validate-tree-fit.js`, 2026-10-28, CHPclim rainfall): RECALL = of the checked trees with ≥3
GBIF records near a place (30 km; 10 km for hill towns), the share the app accepts as able to grow there.
- 9 "tuned" places (used to adjust the frost and sunshine rules): 87 % (136/157); the app accepted 2–68 of 92 trees per place.
- 5 "holdout" places, not looked at while tuning (Pune, Bhopal, Guwahati, Srinagar, Chennai): 76 % (82/108).
  Their misses led to the soil-texture change above, so a 5-place "fresh" set (Hyderabad, Lucknow, Ahmedabad,
  Ranchi, Thiruvananthapuram) is in the script for an unbiased figure; re-run it to get that number.
Most remaining misses are city trees that need more rain than the place gets (kadam, saptaparni in Delhi and Pune:
planted and watered) or planted non-natives (teak in Dehradun). Precision is not measured (absence from GBIF is weak
evidence, and GBIF city records include planted trees). One run uses many Open-Meteo calls: run it at most once an hour.

Our own choices (documented in `frontend/forest-eyes/tree-fit.js`): sunshine hours per ECOCROP light class
(very bright 7, clear skies 5, cloudy skies 3, light shade 1.5, heavy shade 0 h/day); modelled soil pH up to 0.5
outside a tree's range counts as "with care", not "unsuitable"; ECOCROP's killing temperature of 0 means "no input"
and is treated as unknown. Three rules were changed after validation showed them rejecting trees that grow there:
a tree Kew records as native in the place's region is not ruled out by ECOCROP's frost limit when a normal winter is
at most 3 °C colder than it (banj oak, horse chestnut at Shimla); sunshine never rules a tree out (the hours
conversion is uncalibrated; wild cherry in London); soil texture never rules a tree out (banyan, shisham, mahua on
the Deccan's clay). Team trees: up to 15 % beyond the recorded rainfall and 2 °C beyond the recorded mean
temperature is "with care"; a normal winter more than 5 °C below the lowest recorded temperature rules it out.
